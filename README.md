This is a mousehunt map helper for all the maptains in Gnawnia! The working site can be found here: https://topheryun.github.io/mh-map-helper

I'm dumping all of the suggestions I come across in the suggestions.txt.  I'm quite a noob when it comes to web applications, so bear with the slow updates. Currently there is no database, the values are stored in a large hashmap inside miceArray.js for now.  I have a bunch of things I want to add, and hopefully this can be a useful tool for maptains as well as people who want to dip their feet into the world of mapping and sniping.
