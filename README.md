This is a mousehunt map helper for all the maptains in Gnawnia! The working site can be found here: https://topheryun.github.io/mh-map-helper

# Instructions

The intended way for this tool to be used is copying the entire mice list in a fresh map, pasting it into the text area in the tool, then either pressing enter or clicking outside the text area. It will then popular a table with the same mice list along with general snipe prices for each mouse. Adjusting the Rare, Difficulty, and Map Type values to match your treasure map will fill out the four boxes below and give you a profit calculation. This number indicates how much money you would make if you have all of the mice sniped. Fiddling with those four boxes will change the profit number based on what you input.

# Suggestions

I'm dumping all of the suggestions I come across in the suggestions.txt.  I'm quite a noob when it comes to web applications, so bear with the slow updates. Currently there is no database, the values are stored in a large hashmap inside micePriceMap.js for now.  I have a bunch of things I want to add, and hopefully this can be a useful tool for maptains as well as people who want to dip their feet into the world of mapping and sniping.
